N:    The debian/watch file in this package doesn't start a version= line. The
N:    first non-comment line of debian/watch should be a version= declaration.
N:    This may mean that this is an old version one watch file that should be
N:    updated to the current version.
N:    
N:    Refer to the uscan(1) manual page for details.

N:    While parsing the Debian changelog, a syntax error was found. If you
N:    have old changelog entries that don't follow the current syntax but that
N:    you want to keep as-is for the historical record, add the line:
N:    
N:      Old Changelog:
N:    
N:    with no leading whitespace before the legacy entries. This line and
N:    everything after it will be ignored.

N: 
N:    The date in the changelog entry is not consistent with the actual
N:    weekday. Either the date is wrong or the weekday is wrong.
N:    
N:    To avoid problems like this, consider using a tool like dch(1) or
N:    date(1) to generate the date. Example:
N:    
N:      $ date -R -ud '2013-11-05 23:59:59'
N:      Tue, 05 Nov 2013 23:59:59 +0000
