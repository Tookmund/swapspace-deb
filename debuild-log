configure: WARNING: unrecognized options: --disable-maintainer-mode
W: swapspace source: configure-generated-file-in-source config.status
N: 
N:    Leaving config.cache/status causes autobuilders problems. config.cache
N:    and config.status are produced by GNU autoconf's configure scripts. If
N:    they are left in the source package, autobuilders may pick up settings
N:    for the wrong architecture.
N:    
N:    The clean rule in debian/rules should remove this file. This should
N:    ideally be done by fixing the upstream build system to do it when you
N:    run the appropriate cleaning command (and don't forget to forward the
N:    fix to the upstream authors so it doesn't happen in the next release).
N:    If that is already implemented, then make sure you are indeed cleaning
N:    it in the clean rule. If all else fails, a simple rm -f should work.
N:    
N:    Note that Lintian cannot reliably detect the removal in the clean rule,
N:    so once you fix this, please ignore or override this warning.

N: 
N:    The source of the following file is missing. Lintian checked a few
N:    possible paths to find the source, and do not find it.
N:    
N:    Please repack your package to include the source or add it to
N:    "debian/missing-sources" directory.
N:    
N:    If this is a false-positive, please report a bug against Lintian.

N: 
N:    This package contains debian/*.ex and/or debian/ex.* files installed by
N:    dh_make. These are intended to be filled in with the package's details
N:    and renamed for use by various debhelper commands. If they are not being
N:    used, they should be removed.

W: swapspace source: debian-watch-file-missing-version
N: 
N:    The debian/watch file in this package doesn't start a version= line. The
N:    first non-comment line of debian/watch should be a version= declaration.
N:    This may mean that this is an old version one watch file that should be
N:    updated to the current version.

N:    Refer to the uscan(1) manual page for details.

N: 
N:    While parsing the Debian changelog, a syntax error was found. If you
N:    have old changelog entries that don't follow the current syntax but that
N:    you want to keep as-is for the historical record, add the line:
N:    
N:      Old Changelog:
N:    
N:    with no leading whitespace before the legacy entries. This line and
N:    everything after it will be ignored.
